    <h1>School</h1>
    <p>The taxi comes to a hault outside your old school. You pay and thank the driver. The car pulls away leaving you infront of the creepy looking building.</p>
    <p>Heaving the door open you notice the hall is eerily silent. As you walk you hear what sounds like sobs of a child</p>
    <p>The sobs get louder as your near one of the medium sized classrooms</p>
    <p>Do you enter the classroom or carry on down the hall?</p>
