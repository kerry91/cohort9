    <h1>Classroom</h1>
    <p>You open the classroom door where the sobs are coming from. Stepping inside you see what looks like a child with its back to you face against the wall.</p>
    <p>You call out asking if the child is ok. There is no answer the sobs carry on.</p>
    <p>Do you comfort the child or flee from the classroom?</p>
